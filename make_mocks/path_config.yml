  N: 1800
  L: 1000
  redshift: 0.2
  photsys: "S"
  #num_redshifts: 1 # Number of redshifts for which the mass function is measured
  mag_faint: 20.0
  mag_faint_type: "apparent" # Whether the faint magnitude limit is apparent or absolute; depends on whether mock is cut-sky or cubic-box
  #these probably don't need to be changed in most situations
  log_mass_min: -11
  logMmin: 10.3 # Minimum mass of unresolved halo tracers for BGS or what have you
  logMmax: 11 # Maximum mass of unresolved halo tracers; SHOULD BE CHANGED FOR FLAMINGO
  ntracer: 3 # Number of satellite tracers for each halo
  particles: False # use particles to position galaxy tracers if True, NFW if False; True not yet supported with Flamingo
  mag_faint_extrapolate: -17 #If specified, the HOD parameters Mmin and M1 will be extrapolated linearly fainter than this magnitude. Default is -17
